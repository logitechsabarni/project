In Python, randint is a function from the random module that generates a random integer within a specified range.
Here's a simple number guessing game in Python. The program will randomly choose a number between a specified range, and the player will try to guess it.
1. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. If the guess is too low or too high, the program gives feedback to the user.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, and the program will display how many attempts it took to guess the number.
We can modify the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` variables to adjust the difficulty of the game.
